# Guide

Need help navigating this handbook?

## Side Tab

On the left, there is a navigation tab that has multiple collapsable topics that branch out into more specific pages.

::: warning Disclaimer for Mobile Devices
On mobile devices there is no visible side tab, but rather a "Menu" on the top **left** of the screen.

## Aside

On the right, there will be what VitePress calls an "Aside" tab. The Aside is a general outline of what is on the current page. You can go directly to a specific topic on a page with this tab.

On mobile devices there is no visible aside tab, but rather a collapsable "On this page" menu on the top **right** of the screen.

## Search

The search bar runs a fuzzy full-text search on the entire handbook. It's not very useful LOL but it's there for you if you need it.
