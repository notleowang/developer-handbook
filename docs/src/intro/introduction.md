# What is this Developer Handbook?

This handbook is a personal place for me to preview code snippets and other useful programming-related topics so that I can come back to them later.

I am generally pretty forgetful and so jotting down all my notes somewhere is very helpful to me.

## Questions

- **Can I use this handbook?**

    Of course, that's why I deployed the website publically after all.

- **Why are you doing this?**

    Why not?! On a more serious note, I am a hands-on learner and so simply writing down code or my thoughts allows me to grasp concepts better. I also like to stay organized.
